This repository contains a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of passwords. It evaluates passwords against various criteria and provides users with feedback on how secure their passwords are. The tool aims to promote better password practices by guiding users on how to improve weak passwords.

Features Comprehensive Strength Evaluation: Checks password length. Verifies the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters. Ensures inclusion of numeric digits. Detects special characters (e.g., @, #, $). Real-Time Feedback: Informs users if their password is weak, moderate, or strong. Offers actionable suggestions to strengthen weak passwords. Customizable Rules: Easily adjust the minimum length or required character sets based on specific security needs. Interactive User Interface: Prompts users to input a password and displays results instantly. How It Works Users input a password for evaluation. The tool analyzes the password against predefined criteria: Minimum length requirement. Combination of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters). The tool calculates a strength score and provides feedback: Weak: Does not meet basic security requirements. Moderate: Meets some criteria but could be improved. Strong: Satisfies all criteria for a secure password. If weak or moderate, suggestions are displayed to help users create a stronger password.
